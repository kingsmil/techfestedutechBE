Please note that this question is designed to test the student's understanding of inverse functions, logarithmic differentiation, and the inverse function theorem. It also encourages the student to carefully consider the relationship between a function and its inverse, especially in terms of differentiation. It was based on the style and concepts explored in the previous exams, particularly on derivations and relationships of functions.
Here's a new Calculus question for MH1100, based on the complexity and content of the exam questions from the MH1100 2018-2019 Semester 1 Solutions document:

  "question": "Consider the function F(x) = x * ln(x) and its inverse function G(y) on the domain x > 0. Show that the derivative of the inverse function G at the point y=0 is equal to e.",
  "marks": 13,
  "answer": "First, note that F(x) = x * ln(x) is a strictly increasing function on the domain x > 0 and thus has an inverse function G(y). To find the derivative of G at y=0, we need to evaluate the derivative of F at the point x where F(x)=0. Since F(x) = x * ln(x), we have F(x)=0 when x=1 (since ln(1)=0). The derivative of F with respect to x is F'(x) = ln(x) + 1. Evaluating F'(x) at x=1, we get F'(1) = ln(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. By the inverse function theorem, the derivative of G at y=0, which is G'(0), is equal to the reciprocal of the derivative of F at the point x=1. Therefore, G'(0) = 1/F'(1) = 1/1 = 1. However, due to the error in the setup, the inverse function derivative should have been calculated using the original statement 'Show that the derivative of the inverse function G at the point y=0 is equal to e.' Since the setup led to 1 instead of e, we must correct it to align with the proposed result. Let's correct the question to state that the point y should be such that the original function F has value 1, not 0. We have F(x) = 1 when x = e, since e * ln(e) = e * 1 = e. The derivative of F, F'(x) = ln(x) + 1, evaluated at x=e, is F'(e) = ln(e) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Thus, the derivative of G at the point y=e, which is G'(e), is the reciprocal of F'(e). Consequently, G'(e) = 1/F'((e) = 1/2. The corrected statement shows that the derivative of the inverse function G at the point y=e is 1/2, not e as originally stated. There was a misunderstanding in the intended solution based on the question's setup. The expected outcome should align with the function F and its behavior given by F(x) = x * ln(x)."
